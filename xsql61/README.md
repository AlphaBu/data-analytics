Xilinx Text Table based TPCH Query 6 and 1
==========================================

This README file contains the following sections:
  1. OVERVIEW
  2. DESIGN FILE HIERARCHY  
  3. COMPILATION AND EXECUTION

## 1. OVERVIEW
This directory provides sample kernel implementation for Query 6 and Query 1 on TPCH data tables. It can be run on F1 instances to produce high quality TPCH results.

## 2. DESIGN FILE HIERARCHY

## 3. COMPILATION AND EXECUTION

### Compiling to create host code
Set up environment for Xilinx SDx release
```
$source <SDX_INSTALL_DIR>/settings64.sh
```
Make XDB connector library in database/xdbconn (see README for instructions)
Build host code fo rtpch
```
make
```
Run TPCH query with the lineitem table csv file
```
$make QUERYNO=6 DBMODE=csv run_sw_emu
```
To run TPCH query with the lineitem table csv file
```
$make QUERYNO=6 DBMODE=csv run_hw_emu
```
Run TPCH query 6 using HLS C functions as OpenCL kernel on acceleration card

Compile host code and xclbin for F1 hardware
```
$make host xbin
```
Here is a brief step by step instruction on how to run it on the AWS-F1 platform:

* Building the executable by calling:
```
make all XPART=AWS
```
* Building the xclbin by calling:
```
make xbin FLOW=hw QUERYNO=6
```
Chnage queryno to 1 to create the xclbin for query 6

### Amazon AWS F1 execution

You can learn more on these links [Amazon F1 hardware](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/f1), [Official AWS github](https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga) and [AWS FPGA Forums](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=243&start=0)

* Creating and registering the AFI

Please follow AWS instructions to create an AFI image for Amazon F1.

* Check AFI registration:

```
more *afi_id.txt
aws ec2 describe-fpga-images --fpga-image-ids <afi-id from file>
```
* Setup and execute

To run query 6 please use the following command 
```
sudo sh
source /opt/Xilinx/SDx/2017.1.rte/setup.sh
bin/xsqltpch -kernel sqlq6tpch -xclbin <replace_with_aws_xclbin_name>  -query 6 -db test/samplelineitem.tbl -ntuples 256"
```
To run query 1 please use the following command 
```
sudo sh
source /opt/Xilinx/SDx/2017.1.rte/setup.sh
bin/xsqltpch -kernel sqlq6tpch -xclbin <replace_with_aws_xclbin_name>  -query 1 -db test/samplelineitem.tbl -ntuples 256"
```
Please look at the options provided for bin/xsqltpch to run it in different modes. You can feed in larger lineitem.tbl generated by TPCH dbgen. This code has been checked with up to 100GB of data size, and it scales with the data design for TBytes of data sizes as well.
